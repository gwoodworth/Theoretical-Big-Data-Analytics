Course files from Theoretical Big Data Analytics (M462) at University of Montana, Spring 2019.
Course Description:
"The main goal of this course is to provide students with a unique opportunity to acquire conceptual knowledge 
and theoretical background behind mathematical tools applicable to Big Data Analytics and Real Time Computations. 
Specific challenges of Big Data Analytics, e.g., problems of extracting, unifying, updating, and merging information, 
and processing of highly parallel and distributed data, will be reviewed. The tools for Big Data Analytics, such as 
regression analysis, linear estimation, calibration problems, real time processing of incoming (potentially infinite) 
data, will be studied in more detail. It will be shown how these approaches can be transformed to conform to the Big Data demands. 
Level: Undergraduate"
